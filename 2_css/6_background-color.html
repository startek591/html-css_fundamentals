  <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
  <p>Almost anything can be found in seaweater. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's crust as well as materials from 
    organisms. The most important components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases
    (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in tehir composition as well as in their influence
    on marine life.
